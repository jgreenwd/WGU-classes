# CAPSTONE FINAL PROJECT

This project was completed as part of my BS in Computer Science. It serves to indicate the application of many of the skills I have developed through the pursuit of this degree: Software Engineering, Software Testing, Algorithmic Analysis, Data Management, User Interface Design, Project Management, and Business Applications.


## DESCRIPTION
TLaP explores the use of machine learning in pitch classification for regular season Major League Baseball.
